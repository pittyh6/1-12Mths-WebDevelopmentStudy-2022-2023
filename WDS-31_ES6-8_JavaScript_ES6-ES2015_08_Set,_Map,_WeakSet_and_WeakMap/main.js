Description
WeakSet objects are collections of objects. Just as with Sets, 
each object in a WeakSet may occur only once; all objects in a WeakSet's collection are unique.

//WEAKMAP
/*A WeakMap is a collection of key/value pairs whose keys must be objects, 
with values of any arbitrary JavaScript type, and which does not create strong references 
to its keys. That is, an object's presence as a key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object from 
being garbage collected. Once an object used as a key has been collected, 
its corresponding values in any WeakMap become candidates for garbage collection as well â€” 
as long as they aren't strongly referred to elsewhere.*/
